    <h1>Chronically Homeless in St. Louis County</h1>
    <p>A comparison of the number of chronically homeless people with the number of housing units dedicated to people who need ongoing support to stay housed during the decade the Ten-Year Plan to End Chronic Homelessness was in place. People in permanent housing are not included in the annual homeless count. That means people counted as chronically homeless either have refused housing or have no permanent place to go.</p>
