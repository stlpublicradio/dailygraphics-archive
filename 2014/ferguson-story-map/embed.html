		<p>On Saturday, Aug. 9, an unarmed 18-year-old black man named Michael Brown was shot and killed by Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson. Since then, the movement seeking justice for his death has grown, as has the police response. First the County took over, then the State Highway Patrol. A curfew has been instituted and dropped. The National Guard has been called in, as has the Department of Justice. What's going on in Ferguson now extends beyond its borders. But let's start there.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="slide">
		<h1>Where is Ferguson?</h1>
		<p>Ferguson is a suburb of St. Louis, located in St. Louis County. The metropolitan area has around 2.8 million people. St. Louis County is home to about 1 million. Ferguson has about 21,000 people.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="slide">
		<h1>About Ferguson</h1>
		<p>Census data show that Ferguson is younger than the St. Louis County average: Ferguson's median age is around 34 years old, while St. Louis County's is nearly 40. African Americans make up about two-thirds of Ferguson's population, while only about one-quarter of St. Louis County's population is black. <a href="http://news.stlpublicradio.org/post/ferguson-numbers" target="_parent">Read more about the basics of Ferguson and St. Louis County&#8217;s population.</a></p>

		<h1>August 9: Darren Wilson's path</h1>
		<p>According to police reports, at around 11:50 a.m. on Saturday, Aug. 9, an officer responded to a sick case on Glenark Drive in Ferguson. The unit was cleared and the event was closed at seven seconds after noon, according to the reports. At a press conference on Friday, Aug. 15, Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson said Officer Darren Wilson responded to a sick case shortly before the confrontation leading to Brown's death.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="slide">
		<h1>August 9: Michael Brown's path</h1>
		<p>Ferguson police at the Friday news conference also produced a police report and security camera video showing a person appearing to be Michael Brown involved in what they called "strong-arm robbery." According to the report, witnesses at the scene told responding officers that Brown and another man walked north on West Florissant after leaving the store. The report said the incident lasted from 11:52:58 a.m. to 11:54 according to timestamps on the security camera video.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="slide">
		<h1>August 9: The shooting</h1>
		<p>Details are scant on the shooting (including this approximate location). Both police and witnesses say Wilson initially contacted Brown because he was walking in the street. From there, accounts diverge. Witnesses say Brown was surrendering with his hands up when he was shot. Police say he assaulted Wilson. Preliminary autopsy results show Brown was shot at least six times, including twice in the head. According to police, the shooting scene became difficult to manage, with reports of more shots being fired from nearby.</p>
