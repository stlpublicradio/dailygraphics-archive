		<td data-title="What">John Pitman Drive</td>
		<td data-title="Why">Archer came to Missouri with James Alexander and his family in 1829. Archer was sold sometime after 1846 by his executor, William Campbell, to the Pitman family. Around that time he was also separated from his wife Louisa. He arrived at this location in St. Charles County that year. This is the graveyard of the Pitman family. This is also the property of the farm that Archer was fleeing from.</td>

	<tr>
		<td data-title="Where"><strong>2</strong></td>
		<td data-title="What">Archer Alexander Creek</td>
		<td data-title="Why">Missouri Secretary of State John Ashcroft issued a proclamation to name a bordering creek after Archer Alexander in 2018. The creek runs through O'Fallon across Highway N and Highway 364 on the former Pitman family property.</td>
	</tr>
	
	<tr>
		<td data-title="Where"><strong>3</strong></td>
		<td data-title="What">Campbell House</td>
		<td data-title="Why">Alexander helped build this home. William Campbell was James Alexander's wife's uncle. Alexander was left in charge of the other slaves, who also helped build this stone house, when Campbell took the Alexander orphans back to family in Virginia. The house was completed in the late 1830s. Archer Alexander was still owned by the Alexander family at the time of construction.</td>
	</tr>
	
	<tr>
		<td data-title="Where"><strong>4</strong></td>
		<td data-title="What">Railroad bridge</td>
		<td data-title="Why">In February 1863, Alexander overheard Confederate sympahtizers at the Campbell House discussing strategy to undermine a nearby railroad bridge over Peruque Creek. He eventually left and alerted Union troops on the activity of the sympathizers. The lieutenant colonel for the Union troops was German abolitionist Arnold Krekel, who led a group of German soldiers. After alerting the troops, Alexander used the underground railroad to escape to St. Louis. He soon after is freed and eventually lives with William Greenleaf Eliot, the founder of Washington University.</td>
	</tr>
	
	<tr>
		<td data-title="Where"><strong>5</strong></td>
		<td data-title="What">St. Peter's Cemetery</td>
		<td data-title="Why">Alexander died Dec. 8, 1880, but his burial site has been shrouded in uncertainty for decades. Historians believed he was buried in Clayton due to Eliot's book, but recent research from Keeven-Franke has confirmed St. Peter's Cemetery as his burial site. The exact location within St. Peter's Cemetery is unknown, but he is buried in the same common lot as his second wife, Julia.</td>
