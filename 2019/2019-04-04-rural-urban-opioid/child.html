    <h1>Injured workers far from cities receive more opioid painkillers</h1>
    <p>Injured workers in urban areas were 14% less likely to receive opioid prescriptions than those working in areas farthest from cities, according to a 2018 study of workplace injuries in 27 states, including Missouri and Illinois, by the Workers Compensation Research Institute. Nearly 70% of injured workers in very rural areas received at least one prescription of opioid painkillers, and a third of them received two or more prescriptions.</p>
