    <h1>Fatal gun violence has increased in the last 15 years in The Ville and Greater Ville</h1>
    <p>Before 2015, police rarely reported more than 10 gun-involved homicides in a year between the two north St. Louis neighborhoods. But since that particularly deadly year, which saw more than 20 fatal shootings in the 1.4-square-mile area, all years have had double-digit homicide totals.</p>

        <h3>Notes</h3>
        <p>Data does not depict years prior to 2004 because information provided by the police department did not consistently report cause of death until that year. Police data associates weapon information with an overall crime, not a specific victim, and only lists one weapon if multiple were used.</p>
