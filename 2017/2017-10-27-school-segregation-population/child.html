    <h1>Do St. Louis schools look like St. Louis&#8217; population?</h1>
    <p>According to the Census, in 2015 there were about 31,000 St. Louis residents who were non-white and aged between 5 and 17. This represents just under 75 percent of all 5- to 17-year-olds in the city. In charter schools in the city, non-white students made up nearly 80 percent of all students. And in St. Louis Public Schools, they represented about 87 percent of all students.</p>

        <h3>Notes</h3>
        <p>School-age population in the city data came from the 1990 and 2000 Census and the 2005, 2010 and 2015 American Community Survey 5-year estimates. DESE redacted data where there were four or fewer students of a race in a school in a year. Not all students&#8217; races were reported.</p>
