    <h1>School segregation in St. Louis</h1>
    <p>Most schools in the city have a higher percentage of non-white students than the city&#8217;s population.<br/><br/>Each dot on the chart represents one school building in each year shown. The percentage is of non-white students, reported by the Department of Elementary and Secondary education. This includes students reported as Hispanic and multiracial. Because not all students&#8217; races were reported, we removed school buildings for which more than five percent of students&#8217; races could not be determined. The dashed line represents the percentage of non-white city residents aged 5-17, according to the Census.</p>

        <h3>Notes</h3>
        <p>School-age population in the city data came from the 1990 and 2000 Census and the 2005, 2010 and 2015 American Community Survey 5-year estimates. DESE redacted data where there were four or fewer students of a race in a school in a year. Not all students&#8217; races were reported.</p>
