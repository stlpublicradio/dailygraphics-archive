We respect the rights of every student in our district, and work hard to ensure that the safety and individual needs of all of our students are met every day. Because the law remains unsettled on this issue, we await decisions by our legislators and the courts for a clear path forward. While Affton School District has not adopted a policy regarding transgender students specifically, the District does have, and has had for many years, a policy in place which serves to protect all students from discrimination and harassment. Affton School District, the Board of Education, and our staff are committed to a culture of nondiscrimination. Students who identify as transgender are protected by this policy, along with all of our students. Therefore, if the District is notified that a student is transgender and the student feels he or she has been treated differently in some way on that basis, we have the necessary and required policies and procedures in place to investigate and address such concerns. Issues of that nature are handled on a case-by-case basis. The privacy of our students is protected by our policies and federal law, and that remains in the forefront of our minds when working through these issues with individual students and families.&#8221;<br/><br/>- Erica Chandler, district spokesperson

We respond based on what students ask us to do. We haven&#8217;t had a problem. We already had bathrooms that were either gender; didn&#8217;t have to change anything.

Even prior to May 2016, we have been operating similarly to the May 2016 guidance provided by the Obama administration. We work with students and families on an individual basis to provide a learning experience that is inclusive and free of harassment and discrimination. The District allows students to access the facilities that align with their gender identity. The District also gives these students private facilities options if they so choose. Obviously, we are watching SB 98 (and the Grimm case in the US Supreme Court) very closely. At the end of the day, we believe that there are many decisions in public education that are best left up to the discretion of a local school board. Deciding which bathroom a student should use is certainly one of them and definitely not an issue we feel needs to be legislated. Local control is a fundamental principle of public education in Missouri. School districts need to retain the flexibility to make individual decisions that are in the best interests of their students and their communities.&#8221;<br/><br/>- Chris Tennill, district spokesperson</span></td>

During the presentation by Tom Durphy from Shands, Elber, Gianoulakis & Gilium, he recommended that we wait for the courts to rule on what we should specifically have in our policies before changing them.  Basically, his presentation outlined some of the different cases now in the court system and their possible implications for schools moving forward.  I&#8217;d be happy to connect you with Tom if you&#8217;d like to hear more from his end. His other recommendation was that we do whatever we can in our current power to accommodate transgender students in a way that does not discriminate against them in any way.  We do not yet have gender neutral restrooms, however, if we do have a student who identifies as transgender, that student is allowed to use our staff restrooms located on every floor in the building. Regarding athletics and the other areas you discussed, we don&#8217;t yet have a policy as we are waiting on rulings from the court system per Tom&#8217;s recommendation.&#8221;<br/><br/>- Mike Malone, executive director
