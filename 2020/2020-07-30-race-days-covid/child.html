    <h1>COVID-19 pandemic hinders Fairmont Park Racetrack&#8217;s plan to host more races</h1>
    <p>Fairmont Park Racetrack representatives said last year they hoped to increase racing days to 100 in 2021. The Illinois Racing Board approved 60 race days for 2020, but due to COVID-19, the racetrack canceled several months of its season. The park resumed races with a non-standard schedule in June, which will allow the park to host as many as 31 total races by the racing season&#8217;s end in mid-September.</p>
