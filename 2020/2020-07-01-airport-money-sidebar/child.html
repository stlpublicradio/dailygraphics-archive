<h1>Who would get $44 million?</h1>
<p>Under the terms of a 2018 contract with consultants hired to explore airport privatization, St. Louis would be required to pay the following funds to three companies if it leases St. Louis Lambert International Airport by July 2021. The money would be paid from proceeds of a deal.</p>


        <h2>Grow Missouri: $15.07 million</h2>
        The Rex Sinquefield-backed consulting firm would be reimbursed for out-of-pocket expenses paid to additional consultants over the length of the project, including Moelis & Company and McKenna & Associates.



        <h2>Moelis & Company: $12.25 million</h2>
        The New York City-based financial advisor vetted companies interested in bidding on the airport and created a shortlist, among other duties.




        <h2>McKenna & Associates: $16.68 million</h2>
        The consulting firm based near Washington, D.C. coordinated additional consultants and provided recommendations on the process and a potential deal, among other duties.
