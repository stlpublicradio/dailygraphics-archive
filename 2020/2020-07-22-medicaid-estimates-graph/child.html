    <h1>Study estimates Missouri could save $39 million in first year of Medicaid expansion</h1>
    <p>Researchers at Washington University&#8217;s Center for Health Economics and Policy estimated in 2019 that expanding Medicaid in Missouri could save the state around $39 million within a year. Researchers created a range of estimates based on other possible outcomes. One showed that if more people enrolled in Medicaid than expected, it could cost the state around $42 million; the other showed that if fewer people enrolled in Medicaid than expected, Missouri could save up to $95 million. The savings could also continue over time, the researchers said.</p>
