    <h1>DOJ's conclusions about Ferguson witnesses</h1>
    <h2>In its report about Darren Wilson's killing of Michael Brown, the Department of Justice concluded there was not enough evidence to prosecute Wilson. The DOJ reached its conclusion in part based on witness testimony and statements. The DOJ found seven witnesses who remained consistent with the physical evidence, their own statements over time, and the other credible witnesses. Eight witnesses, the department said, neither completely helped or hurt the case against Wilson. But the largest group — 24 witnesses — the department discounted, because it said they contradicted the phyiscal evidence or changed their stories significantly over time.<br /><br />CORRECTION: A previous version of this graphic listed an incorrect number for witness 142, an incorrect "reason" for witness 132, and omitted witness 106. We regret the errors.</h2>
