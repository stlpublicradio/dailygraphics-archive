    <h1>What the Missouri Senate and House education bills cover</h1>
    <h2>After passing a comprehensive students transfer bill last year, only to have it vetoed by Gov. Jay Nixon, Missouri lawmakers made a new attempt one of their top priorities this year. The Senate and the House have passed individual versions, with input from the governor's office. Here is a comparison of what the bills would require. A compromise measure would have to pass both chambers before it is sent to the governor.</h2>
