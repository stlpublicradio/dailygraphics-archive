    <h1>Gun Violence as a Public Health Issue</h1>
    <p>The city of St. Louis has seen at least 172 gun-related homicides so far this year, and consistently ranks among cities with the highest per capita rates in the country. Nationally, homicide is the most common cause of death for African Americans between the ages of 15 and 34.
If the rate of shootings and killings in America were truly an epidemic, there would be a public health response. A growing body of research says gun violence can be treated and controlled the same way agencies would address other public health risks… so here’s what it would look like.</p>

Turns out, both were caused by HIV. But until researchers were able to identify the virus and figure out that it’s transmitted through bodily fluids, there wasn’t much they could do to prevent it. </td>
                <td data-title="Vehicle Accidents">The National Safety Council started compiling accident statistics in the early 1920’s. The council noticed that many accidents were due to reckless driving. One of the first safety improvements for cars was shatterproof glass in windshields starting in 1928.</td>
                <td data-title="Gun Violence">Public health research for gun violence is limited, because in the 1990's Congress suspended funding to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for any research that could be seen as advocacy for gun control. Researchers theorize gun violence spreads and clusters in the same way a virus would, and that exposure to violence not only puts a person at risk of being a victim, but makes them more likely to be a perpetrator. Violence doesn’t have to be a shooting in a neighborhood—it could be abuse in the home, or living in a war zone.</td>
