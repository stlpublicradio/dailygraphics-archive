                        <p>Subsidiaries own the neighboring West Lake and Bridgeton landfills. Republic is among the nation’s largest waste-management companies. It became the parent company for the owners of the West Lake and Bridgeton landfills when it bought larger competitor Allied Waste Industries in 2008. Republic assumed at the time that the EPA would stick by its earlier decision to cap West Lake, but otherwise leave the radioactive waste alone. Republic shares liability with Exelon Corp. and the federal Department of Energy. Republic has donated at least $181,000 to state officials, legislators and local officials since 2012.</p>

                        <p>This Chicago-based energy corporation is the nation’s largest operator of nuclear power plants. It was created 15 years ago by mergers of other companies. Its portfolio of companies used to include Cotter Corp., a uranium processing operation that is blamed for some of the radioactive waste at West Lake. Exelon agreed to take on Cotter’s liability for West Lake when the company was sold in 2000. Previously in the background, Exelon has begun to take on a more public role as it contends more of the liability belongs to the federal government.</p>

Blunt is a lawyer and a partner in the Jefferson City firm of Schreimann, Rackers, Francka & Blunt, LLC.  Blunt declined to comment. But those close to him say his chief job for Exelon is to keep it informed of any West Lake-related chatter in Jefferson City. So far, there’s been no related state legislation for him to lobby for or against.</p>

                        <p>The Missouri attorney general – a Democrat running for governor in 2016 – has been particularly active in the landfill controversy for several years, holding news conferences to focus on complaints about odor, water and soil contamination, and the underground fire. His office filed a lawsuit in 2013 against Republic. Some fellow Democrats privately accuse him of scaring residents. His critics point to the hefty campaign donations from personal-injury lawyers and law firms. He’s collected at least $425,000 from the Alton-based law firm of Simmons, Hanly, Conroy, LLC – which represented some of the residents in the now-settled lawsuit against entities controlled by Republic.</p>

                        <p>A Democrat, her Senate district includes the landfills. She was among the marquee figures at the height of the Ferguson unrest. She’s now become an outspoken advocate of the residents’ effort to force removal of the radioactive material at West Lake. She’s also an outspoken critic of Gov. Jay Nixon – who she lambasted over Ferguson – and St. Louis County Executive Steve Stenger, fellow Democrats who she has accused of ignoring the landfill controversy. Chappelle-Nadal has leveled the same accusations against U.S. Rep. William Lacy Clay. She has filed papers to oppose him in next summer’s Democratic primary. She ran afoul of some area Democrats when she endorsed Republican Rick Stream in 2014 for St. Louis County executive.</p>

But he’s come under fire from Chappelle-Nadal, who publicly accused him of not doing enough. (She had endorsed his Republican rival in 2014.) Stenger has resisted calls to declare a county “state of emergency,” saying that wouldn’t do anything.</p>
