    <h1>Medical marijuana proposals on Missouri&#8217;s November 6 ballot</h1>
    <p>Voters will see two amendments and a proposition that would legalize medical marijuana in Missouri. If multiple initiatives end up passing, it would likely be up to the courts to decide what actually gets implemented.</p>

                <td data-title="Amendment 2">Amendment 2 would impose a 4 percent tax on marijuana sales. Money would go to the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services to pay for regulating the program, and any money left over would go to the Missouri Veterans Commission.</td>

Springfield lawyer and physician Brad Bradshaw, the primary backer, would be initially in charge of setting up a board to oversee the center and the medicinal-marijuana program.</td>
                <td data-title="Proposition C">Proposition C calls for a 2 percent tax on the sale of marijuana. The money raised would be split among veteran services, drug treatment and early childhood education.</td>
