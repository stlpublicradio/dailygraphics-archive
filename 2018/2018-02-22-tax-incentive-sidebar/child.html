    <h1>Defining tax incentives</h1>
    <p><h2>Real estate tax abatement:</h2>
Taxes are frozen to the amount a property is worth at project proposal for a set period of time &mdash; usually 5 or 10 years. After that time is up, the developer or homeowner pays full taxes.
<h2>Tax increment financing:</h2>
Taxes are used to subsidize redevelopment, infrastructure and other projects. In St. Louis, property taxes in a TIF district are frozen for 23 years. When the property value increases, the developer still pays the original taxes. The taxes on increased property value generated by the development go into a special allocation fund managed by the comptroller. Half of the sales, earning and payroll taxes generated by the project also go into that allocation fund. Developers are reimbursed for certain project costs &mdash; for instance, to pay back bonds or loans &mdash; from the allocation fund. They&rsquo;re intended for projects that couldn&rsquo;t happen without the incentives.</p>
