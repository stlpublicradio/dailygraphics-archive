    <h1>VICC applications down, but still outpace open spots</h1>
    <p>St. Louis&#8217; school desegregation program, also known as the transfer program or VICC (Voluntary Interdistrict Choice Corporation) has been winding down since 1999. New students transferring from St. Louis to St. Louis County schools have held steady at around 500 students per year for the past decade. Applications for those spots have dropped sharply over the past two years, but there are still more students who apply to suburban schools than are accepted. In 2018-2019, nearly five times as many students applied than were accepted to new spots.</p>
