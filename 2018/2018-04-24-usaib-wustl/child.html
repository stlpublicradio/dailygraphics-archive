    <h1>Investigations find students responsible in about half of cases</h1>
    <p>The University Sexual Assault Investigation Board at Washington University investigates cases after students file a written complaint. The board has completed 39 cases since it was established in January 2013. Most cases take seven to nine months, according to Wash U&#8217;s Title IX Office. About 56 percent of students accused were found &#8220;responsible.&#8221; The university has not released numbers on expulsions, but not all students found responsible were expelled. Student activists say that the process takes too long, has too low a conviction rate and doesn&#8217;t enforce strong enough consequences. The Title IX Office says its process is fair and thorough, if slow. </p>

        <p>This graphic uses the university&#8217;s language for case outcomes. &#8220;Responsible&#8221; means the panel ruled against the student accused of sexual assault. &#8220;Not Responsible&#8221; means the panel ruled against the student who accused another of sexual assault. &#8220;Withdrawn&#8221; means that the individual who filed the case requested that the investigation cease.</p>
