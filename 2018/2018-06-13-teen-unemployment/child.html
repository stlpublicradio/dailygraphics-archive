    <h1>Teen unemployment slightly lower in St. Louis than U.S.</h1>
    <p>People between the ages of 16 and 19 made up 4.3 percent of the St. Louis metro area&#8217;s workforce in 2016, and 20.9 percent of them were unemployed. That rate is slightly lower than the national rate for teens of 22.6 percent. The unemployment rate for all ages is much lower &mdash; it fell from 8.5 percent in 2011 to 7 percent in 2016 for both the U.S. and St. Louis metro.</p>
