    <h1>Northside Regeneration&#8217;s agreements</h1>
    <p>Development requirements and deadlines in the 2014 agreement between St. Louis and Northside Regeneration differ from those in the 2016 Future Assurances Agreement between Northside Regeneration, the Bank of Washington and the Land Clearance for Redevelopment Authority. A court will decide which of these agreements takes precedence. The city considers the developer to be in default of the portions highlighted in red.</p>

The clock started December 31, 2017. A larger project could meet that requirement over multiple years, as long as the developer starts a new project at least once every 36 months.</td>

It gives Northside Regeneration the right to “reasonably object” to any proposed project that conflicts with the developer’s plans, or whose owner “has evidenced moral turpitude of a nature which could negatively impact the reputation of the Northside Development.”</td>

                <td data-title="Future Assurances Agreement">Northside Regeneration must provide written consent for the city to authorize tax incentives to other developers in the project area. If Northside Regeneration doesn't consent, costs associated with the project receiving tax abatement count towards the developer’s minimum requirements.</td>

                <td data-title="Future Assurances Agreement">This agreement pledges that the LCRA will "promptly" make "good faith" negotiations to amend existing redevelopment agreements. SLDC head Otis Williams called it "a little more than a letter of intent" at a hearing in June.
